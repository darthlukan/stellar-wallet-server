## Description

Stellar Wallet Server is yet another cryptocurrency Wallet built specifically
with the [Stellar Network](https://www.stellar.org/) in mind, for now. It is meant
to provide a REST API for any number of clients seeking a simple means of interacting
with [Stellar Lumens (XLM)](https://www.stellar.org/lumens).

*IMPORTANT*: _This is a personal project that is not (yet) meant for production use and should be considered highly volatile._
